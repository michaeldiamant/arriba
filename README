Arriba is a performant FIX engine implementation that utilizes Netty and the Disruptor pattern.

As of the writing of this README, there is no Disruptor dependency available through a central Maven repository.  Until this happens, the project must be checked out from http://code.google.com/p/disruptor/ and added as a dependency manually.
